# Bryan's Personal Website V2
This is a project I started planning to turn my [plain text personal website](https://bryanl530.github.io/Bryan_Website/) to something more flexible.

## Progress 11/6/25
Explored ways to put the icons next to the text for the github repo link. I also planned on ways to create the project components. It will be
using json for now.

## Progress 11/5/25
Today I had some ideas on how I might want the project section to look like. I am also not doing it too fast in case of me wanting to add
content to the section.

## Progress 11/4/25
Planning out the strucutre of the webpage. 

## Progress 11/3/25
