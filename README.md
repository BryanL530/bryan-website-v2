# Bryan's Personal Website V2
This is a project I started planning to turn my [plain text personal website](https://bryanl530.github.io/Bryan_Website/) to something more flexible.

## Progrss 11/13/25
I think I've finished the project section for now. I also added pictures and selected the color theme of the website. I want to merge the about-me and the skills section. It is curently under my imagination. Will most likely take few days until I found a design I like and went to implementation.

## Progress 11/12/25
Writing the skills section 🔥🔥🔥. Had some ideas with react-icons but it is missing some icons and not a single style for all of them. So scrapped that idea. I think having the skills list will be enough for today. May or maynot find new skills to learn in the process. I am hoping to find a design I like in the next few days.

Polishing porjects section again. I feel like the projet content is mostly finished besides picking a color or the whole website. I also picked some icons at google fonts. It does make things look a bit nicer.

## Progress 11/10/25
Mainly focusing on listing all prjects I have or remembered. With the data I have I could start working on formatting them in the webpage.

## Progress 11/6/25
Explored ways to put the icons next to the text for the github repo link. I also planned on ways to create the project components. It will be
using json for now.

## Progress 11/5/25
Today I had some ideas on how I might want the project section to look like. I am also not doing it too fast in case of me wanting to add
content to the section.

## Progress 11/4/25
Planning out the strucutre of the webpage. 

## Progress 11/3/25
I started this project today, spend some time learning how to host react onto github. Marking the start of this project.
