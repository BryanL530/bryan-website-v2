# Bryan's Personal Website V2
This is a project I started planning to turn my [plain text personal website](https://bryanl530.github.io/Bryan_Website/) to something more flexible.

## Progress 11/3/25
I started this project today, spend some time learning how to host react onto github. Marking the start of this project.
